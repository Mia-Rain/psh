# pSH: portable pureSH util replacements
-------------------------------
# pSH is a single script which can be sourced (`.`)
# to replace basic utils such as
  - grep
  - seq
  - cat
  - ls
  - touch
# with pure(POSIX)SH ones 
# allowing for faster, and more portable (shell) scripts
-------------------------------
# scripts are grabbed from (github) ThatGeekyWeeb/shapplet
-------------------------------
# Requires:
  - curl
  - /bin/sh
-------------------------------
# Usage:
. ./psh
# running this will replace all utils listed @ ThatGeekyWeeb/shapplet
# with pureSH functions
-------------------------------
